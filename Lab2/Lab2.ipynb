        "* Docking programs can consider some _residue sidechains to be flexible_ during docking calculations to account for binding pocket flexibility. However, the _dynamic, adaptive nature_ of the protein\\-ligand binding and the contribution of the conformational entropy of the protein is insufficiently considered by protein\\-ligand docking. This can result in false positives: Even if the ligand finds a suitable pose in the binding pocket, _this position is not guaranteed_ until the protein is allowed to explore near\\-minima conformations. Hence, short _molecular dynamics \\(MD\\) simulations_ are recommended to evaluate the stability of the predicted binding pose ([https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602](https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602)\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Scoring functions** used by docking programs must be _cheap to compute_. While the accuracy is good enough to distinguish good poses from bad poses, it can have _problems sorting the best poses_. For example, while most popular docking programs are able to find the experimental pose in their calculations, this pose is rarely the best one of the proposed set. Furthermore, several retrospective studies have shown that _docking scores often poorly correlate with binding affinity_ (https://doi.org/10.1021/jm050362n), (https://doi.org/10.1039/c6cp01555g).  \n",
        "\n",
        "* While blind docking is possible, in order to reduce computational cost, docking is often only performed on a subset of the protein \\(typically around a known binding pocket\\). _Choosing the correct binding site is a challenge_, if the binding pocket is not known a priori.\n",
        "\n",
        "* To maximize the accuracy of the calculation, the ligand and protein structures must be _prepared appropriately_. Protonation states of amino acids and the ligands can be tricky to get right, especially in the case of \\(potential\\) tautomers. This introduces yet another cause to obtain inaccurate results.\n",

In contrast, physically rigorous **free energy simulations** can model all of the phenomena outlined above. In particular, alchemical free energy methods such as free energy perturbation (**FEP**) have been highly successful in the last decade. To this end, **Molecular Dynamics** (MD) simulations are performed to sample the Boltzmann distribution of the protein-ligand complex, while continuously _turning off selection interactions_ between the protein and the ligand (much more complicated than that).\n",
        "\n",
        "The accuracy of the MD simulation (and consequently the accuracy of the binding free energy estimate) critically depends on the _employed force field_. While to date, almost all free energy simulations are performed using classical force fields, **neural network potentials** (NNPs) promise increased accuracy by modeling higher body-order interactions. However, due to the significantly increased computational cost of NNPs compared to classical force fields, this increases the need for (ML-supported) **enhanced sampling** schemes to speed-up MD simulations.\n",
