However, these programs require a prior computation of ligand conformations that are used during shape comparison.This will fail if the biologically relevant conformation is not present in this library.\n",

    "* In the **incremental instruction** method, the ligand is first deconstructed into smaller fragments by breaking its rotatable bonds. One of the fragments, for example the biggest one, is placed first into the binding pocket. Subsequently, the complete ligand is incrementally constructed inside the binding pocket by connecting the remaining fragments at the appropriate positions of the core fragment. \n",

    "* Docking programs can consider some residue sidechains flexible during docking calculations to account for binding pocket flexibility. However, the dynamic, adaptive nature of the protein\\-ligand binding and the contribution of the conformational entropy of the protein is insufficiently considered by protein\\-ligand docking. This can result in false positives: Even if the ligand finds a suitable pose in the binding pocket, this position is not guaranteed until the protein is allowed to explore near\\-minima conformations. Hence, short molecular dynamics \\(MD\\) simulations are recommended to evaluate the stability of the predicted binding pose \\(\\[\\_Curr Comput Aided Drug Des\\_ \\(2011\\), \\_\\_7\\_\\_, 2, 146\\-157\\]\\([https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602\\\\](https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602%5C)\\)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scoring functions used by docking programs must be cheap to compute. While the accuracy is good enough to distinguish good poses from bad poses, it can have problems sorting the best poses. For example, while most popular docking programs are able to find the experimental pose in their calculations, this pose is rarely the best one of the proposed set. Furthermore, several retrospective studies have shown that docking scores often poorly correlate with binding affinity \\(\\[\\_J Med Chem\\_ \\(2006\\), \\_\\_49\\_\\_, 20, 5912\\-31\\]\\(https://doi.org/10.1021/jm050362n\\), \\[\\_Phys Chem Chem Phys\\_ \\(2016\\), \\_\\_18\\_\\_, 18, 12964\\-75\\]\\(https://doi.org/10.1039/c6cp01555g\\)\\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* While blind docking is possible, in order to reduce computational cost, docking is often only performed on a subset of the protein \\(typically around a known binding pocket\\). Choosing the correct binding site is a challenge, if the binding pocket is not known a priori.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To maximize the accuracy of the calculation, the ligand and protein structures must be prepared appropriately. Protonation states of amino acids and the ligands can be tricky to get right, especially in the case of \\(potential\\) tautomers. This introduces yet another cause to obtain inaccurate results.\n",
