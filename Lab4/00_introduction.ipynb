    "\n",
    "[Add picture zooming out from protein-drug interaction, to complex/pathway, to organelle, cell, tissue, organ, organism]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't model biological systems from fundamentals on up, so we want to combine _measurements_, i.e. bio-assays, with modelling to best enable drug discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can measure from sub-cellular compartments through whole organisms; but cell lines are the work horse. \n",

    "### Transcriptomics\n",
    "#### Why\n",
    "[Cartoon plot on why, one axis with scalability, another with interpretability; add some misc points, e.g.  with transcriptomics being fairly balanced]\n",
